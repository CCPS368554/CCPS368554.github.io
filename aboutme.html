  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>One of the things I'm working on is becoming a collegiate athlete for running. Also, I'd want to earn a degree in computer science or software development. I'm striving to become a physics programmer or even a software developer. Later in life I would also want to travel the world and see new sites and take a dive into the diverse culture of the world. In my personal life, I want to set out and learn a new instrument-currently working on guitar- and maybe even learn a new language. Lastly, I just wanted to say, though it sounds crazy, I just want to live near the coast with a beach that has rideable waves to surf on and work remotely or work from home to have enough family time. Work during the week, and fun on the weekends. Simple as that. 

Some ways that I'm working towards these goals is with help from my teachers and the school's resources. In order to become a collegiate athlete for running, I have to consistently attend practice and make sure I am consuming the right nutrition. I'd also have to reach out to college coaches saying I would be interested in their running program. In order to become a programmer, I have to learn coding languages such as python and C++. Another way would be going into a boot-camp of software development and from there I could look from jobs that have an opening. In order to learn a new skillset such as learning the guitar or a new language, I have to play the guitar everyday and learn how to play chords and so much more. For a new language, I'd have to listen to the language everyday and learn how to speak common phrases with the language. Right now, I'm trying to perfect my Spanish.

Certain values that I consider most necessary for my success is having perseverance and courage. You have to believe in yourself to follow your goals and your dream and this requires courage. You need perseverance because when the going gets tough, you'll need to bounce back from failures and learn from your mistakes in order to achieve greatness.

Some short term goals that I'd like to accomplish is by improving my track times throughout the season so that I can move up the rankings. This will attract college coaches and serve as a higher chance into getting into their program. Another short term goal I have is having 100 service hours before senior year. I'm already halfway there and I am involved in Interact Club which is a club that goes around the community helping organizers, charity events, and the less fortunate. 

The character traits I want to be known for is being a hard worker, being very inclusive, and always having the mindset to strive for greatness. Some achievements I want to be known for is going to college for running, breaking school records, earning a degree in college, becoming a successful software developer, and raising a wonderful and beautiful family.
